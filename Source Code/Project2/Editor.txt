              Analysis of The Death of Moth 
          A multidirectional and meaningful piece of literature was written by Virginia Woolf,
 in which she had used “Life and Death” as her main theme. This essay shows the speakers
 point of views about life and death and all the struggles that a life does to protect 
itself, she witnessed the moth’s struggles to escape through her windowpane till the 
death conquered over his life. 
         At first, we can see her deep relation with her surrounding nature, that how
 she is making valuable meanings from the little things she was observing. When she 
saw the moth, she took it as an emaciated creature trying to live its life to its 
fullest but them she started drowning more in to her observation, she realized that
 moth is a metaphor of life. “He was little or nothing but life.” [1]. She then talked
 about the energy that made the moth fluttering from side to side of the windowpane,
 she stared feeling pity for him, it was trying to live to the full and flew vigorously
 but what he can do? Fly to the next corner and then next corner? That points of her 
reflects the harsh boundaries that our life encages us into, at that point she is showing
 the similarity of life between humans and moth, they both have same energy that make them 
work with enthusiasm but it all proves meaningless at the end. As Marcus Aurelius said, 
“It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.” [2].
       Moth looked as a frail creature but a pure fiber full of energy, capable to fight
 for its life, actually by talking about that energy and struggles he made, “The energy 
which inspired the rooks, the ploughmen…” [1]. Woolf wanted to express us the phenomenon 
of life that how all us want to live the life and how we all made struggles even knowing 
that we can’t defeat the death. Same thing is written by Keisei Tagami, “Do not seek death. 
But do not fear it either. There can’t be life without death, it is inescapable.” [3] And 
that’s what we do, we know we can’t stop death but still we don’t seek death we try to live 
with full energy.
       After a time, the speaker noted the struggles are fading and that vigor is ending and
 that’s what happens in our lives too after putting all our efforts when we can’t make it our
 energy and hope starts dying and that is where death start conquering us. She tried to help 
the moth by stretching her pencil but she realized it’s already on the verge of death and now 
no help will be helpful, by this she is trying to reflect a very important message for all of 
us that though death is undefeatable but if you help someone when one is facing the harshness 
of the life then you may save a little life for some time or to let it live lively. “People die 
all the time. Life is a most fragile than we think. So, you should treat others in a way that 
leaves no regrets. Fairly, and if possible, sincerely. It’s too easy to make the effort, then 
weep and wring your hands after the person dies.”-Said Haruki Murakami. [4]
      After all the moth’s efforts death proved as inevitable. Death has more power over life 
and at the same time death is savior of life too. We all do struggles in life to survive but 
some time all we do proves meaningless. As Henry David Thoreau said, “When it’s time to die, 
let us not discover that we have never lived.” [5]. Though death is more powerful still we all 
fight for our existence.
